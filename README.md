## Background

The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) aims to create a unified digital health ecosystem for India. CARE already supports provider-driven HIU workflows, but **patient-facing PHR flows were missing**.  

This project focused on building **patient-centric features** that allow individuals to:  
- Create and manage their ABHA (Ayushman Bharat Health Account) identity.  
- Discover and link health records from different facilities.  
- Manage consent for sharing health information.  
- Subscribe to facilities for real-time record updates.  
- Securely fetch and view their health data.  

By implementing these flows, CARE has been extended from a **provider-only platform** to a **dual-purpose ecosystem** for both providers and patients under ABDM.  

---

## Project Goals

1. **ABHA Enrollment & Authentication**  
   - Support multiple methods of ABHA creation (mobile OTP, Aadhaar, email).  
   - Enable secure login flows and consent PIN setup.  

2. **Profile & ABHA Management**  
   - View, update, and delink ABHA profiles.  
   - Support QR code generation and ABHA card download.  

3. **Discovery & Linking of Records**  
   - Discover health records from HIPs.  
   - Link and confirm records using OTP-based flows.  

4. **Consent Management**  
   - Dashboard to manage requests (approve/deny/revoke).  
   - Auto-approval for trusted HIUs.  

5. **Subscriptions & Notifications**  
   - Allow patients to subscribe to HIPs for automatic record sharing.  
   - Build a notification service for updates.  

6. **Fetching & Viewing Records**  
   - Securely fetch health data using consent artefacts.  
   - Display structured timeline of records with filters/search.

## Challenges Faced

- **ABDM APIs:** Working with evolving ABDM APIs required continuous updates to match new specifications.  
- **Security Compliance:** Ensuring secure storage of sensitive patient health data while maintaining usability was challenging.  
- **Complex Flows:** Implementing multi-step flows (discovery â†’ linking â†’ consent â†’ fetch) required extensive debugging and testing.  

---

## Current Status of Project

By the end of GSoC, the **PHR Flows module is complete and functional**.  
- Patients can now create ABHA IDs, manage profiles, discover records, approve/reject consent requests, subscribe to facilities, and fetch/view records.  
- CARE has officially extended its functionality to **support both patients and providers** under ABDM.  

---

## Future Work

- Expand support for **FHIR-compliant import/export** of health records.  
- Add **analytics and visual dashboards** for better health insights.  
- Build **Progressive Web App (PWA) support** for offline-first record access.  
- Strengthen **end-to-end encryption** for record sharing.  

---

## My Learnings

Participating in GSoC has been an invaluable experience. Some key takeaways include:  
- Deep understanding of ABDMâ€™s digital health architecture.  
- Hands-on experience with **secure API integrations** and **scalable systems**.  
- Improved skills in writing testable and maintainable code.  
- Better project planning, communication, and collaboration in an open-source setting.
